# Project: Graph Theory 2021

**Student ID:** G00367771

# Introduction
For this module I was tasked to write a program in the Python 3 programming language to search a text file using a regular expression. The program must take a regular expression and the name or path of the file as command line arguments and output the lines of the file matching the regular expression.

A README should be included with the following content: 

* A description of your repository and its contents pitched at a knowledgeable outsider.
* Instructions stating how to run and test your program.
* An explanation of your algorithm.
* Answers to each of the following three questions, up to 500 words each:
  * What is a regular expression?
  * How do regular expressions differ across implementations?
  * Can all formal languages be encoded as regular expressions?

# Research and Development
Before I started to code this project, I first looked back at the first few labs I did this semester. I wanted to make sure I had a good understanding of basic python syntax. In our first few labs we used examples of functions, variables, loops and if statements. I reinforced my understanding of this by reading through [tutorialspoints](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_basic_syntax.html) documentation on python syntax, which I found very helpful and easy to read through.

I then re-watched the [module video](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/166bc23b-d814-42f6-90df-5748712026bc) on regular expressions making sure I had an understanding of what regular expressions are, how they are used and what each metacharacter meant. Regular expressions are essentially a sequence of characters that will specify a search pattern through a string. Metacharacters or known as 'operators' are characters with a unique meaning, from the previous labs I know I will be using the '|', '* ' and the '+' operator. The '|' character indicates zero or one occurence, for example 'a?bc' will match 'abc' and 'ac'. The '* ' character indicates zero or more occurrences, for example 'ab* c' will match 'ac' 'abc' abbc' and so on. The '+' character indicates one or more occurences, for example 'ab+c' will match 'abc, 'abbc, abbbc' and so on, but not 'ac'.
