# Introduction
For this module I was tasked to write a program in the Python 3 programming language to search a text file using a regular expression. The program must take a regular expression and the name or path of the file as command line arguments and output the lines of the file matching the regular expression.

A README should be included with the following content: 

* A description of your repository and its contents pitched at a knowledgeable outsider.
* Instructions stating how to run and test your program.
* An explanation of your algorithm.
* Answers to each of the following three questions, up to 500 words each:
  * What is a regular expression?
  * How do regular expressions differ across implementations?
  * Can all formal languages be encoded as regular expressions?
